# RoadCrosser
A small c# game where you need to cross the road lanes without getting hit by a vehicle. This is based on some of those frog games where you need to do the same.

The game contains topscores, and each level becomes slightly more difficult.

This project is based on a [Snake](http://earleys.be/readproject?project_id=13) game I made a while ago. Of course a lot had to be changed to turn it into this game.

It's definitely not the best code, but it was a fun project nonetheless.
